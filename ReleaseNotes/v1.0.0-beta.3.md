## Overview
SciSharp.MySQL.Replication is a C# implementation of the MySQL replication protocol client. This library allows you to receive events like insert, update, delete with their data and raw SQL queries directly from MySQL.

## What's New in 1.0.0-beta.3
- Added support for .NET 9.0
- Improved handling of binary log events
- Enhanced parsing of JSON type data
- Fixed issues with timestamp conversion
- Performance improvements for large data sets
- Better error handling and reporting
- Updated dependencies to latest stable versions

## Key Features
- Connect to MySQL server as a replica
- Parse and process binary log events in real-time
- Support for all MySQL data types including JSON, BLOB, TEXT, etc.
- Handle various events including:
  - Query events (raw SQL statements)
  - Table maps
  - Row events (insert, update, delete)
  - Format description events
  - Rotate events
  - XID events (transaction identifiers)
- Checksum verification support
- Built-in support for MySQL binary format parsing
- Async/await first design

## Requirements
- .NET 6.0+ or higher
- MySQL server with binary logging enabled
- MySQL user with replication privileges

## Getting Started
```csharp
using SciSharp.MySQL.Replication;

var serverHost = "localhost";
var username = "root";
var password = "your_password";
var serverId = 1; // replication server id

var client = new ReplicationClient();
var result = await client.ConnectAsync(serverHost, username, password, serverId);

if (!result.Result)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Failed to connect: {result.Message}.");
    return;
}

client.PackageHandler += (s, p) =>
{
    Console.WriteLine(p.ToString());
    Console.WriteLine();
}

client.StartReceive();

// Keep your application running to receive events
// ...

await client.CloseAsync();
```
